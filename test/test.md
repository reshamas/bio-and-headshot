This project will improve PyMCs support for modeling spatial processes. There are many possible algorithms one may choose to work on, such as Gaussian process based methods for point processes like Nearest Neighbor GPs or the Vecchia approximation, and models that are types of Gaussian Markov Random Fields, like CAR, ICAR and BYM models. Implementions of these can be found in the R package CARBayes and INLA. Past work in PyMC has shown promising results and this project would build on that.
