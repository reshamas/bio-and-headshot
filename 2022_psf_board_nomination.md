# 2022 PSF Board Nomination Statement

## Introduction
Passions:  statistics, data science, python, open source

## Background

##  Community Contributions
- Data Umbrella (2019-present): I founded a community for underrepresented persons in data science.   I have built a wonderful team of contributors and within only 2.5 years (almost all during the pandemic), we have accomplished so much.  We have organized 6 open source sprints for the scikit-learn and PyMC python libraries and over 50 online events; our YouTube channel has over 1.5K subscribers.  
- [New York City chapter of PyLadies](https://nyc.pyladies.com): From 2017 to present, I have been a very active organizer to the NYC chapter.  The NYC chapter is the 3rd largest PyLadies chapter worldwide.  I was instrumental in reviving a dormant chapter, mentoring new organizers and initiating the International Women's Day social media highlight campaigns in 2019 and 2020. 
- Between 2016 and 2020, I gave over 15 [Git Workshops](https://github.com/reshamas/git-intro-workshop/blob/master/git-workshops.MD) to the community to alleviate the barrier that not having Git skills is to open source and career development.
- [JupyterCon 2020](https://jupytercon.com) Diversity Chair (Jan-Oct 2020)
- Women in Machine Learning & Data Science (WiMLDS): (2015-2020) Board Member, Global Leadership Team Member and New York City chapter organizer. I organizer over 2 dozen events and 5 open source sprints in New York City, Nairobi and San Francisco.  [WiMLDS list of contributions](https://reshamas.github.io/moving-on-from-wimlds/)
- Blogs:  I have written dozens of blogs on topics related to python, data science and diversity and inclusions.  A number of my blogs have over 10K visits.
- Open Source Sprints [PyCon DE Keynote: 5 Years, 10 Sprints, a scikit-learn Open Source Journey](https://youtu.be/ZUqJaCWPvmk); this keynote summarizes the trials, tribulations and joys of organizing a series of sprints, around the world. 
- NumFOCUS [Diversity in Scientific Computing Committee](https://reshamas.github.io/on-receiving-2019-community-leadership-award-from-numfocus/)  2017-2019
- Community Talks:  I've given a number of talks on Python, plotly, git and diversity over the years.  Partial list is on YouTube [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBKcU7Ik-ir84cthbsQ_zU72sG-zUnEQn)

## Community Award
In 2019, I received the [NumFOCUS 2019 Community Service Award](https://numfocus.org/blog/2019-numfocus-awards)
>Reshama was selected to receive this award in acknowledgment of the strong positive impact she has had in diversifying the NumFOCUS community, particularly by focusing on the inclusion of more women. She served on the NumFOCUS Diversity & Inclusion in Scientific Computing (DISC) Steering Committee from 2017-2019 and has exemplified leadership by producing thoughtful, thought-provoking, and data-driven blogs that challenge the community to look squarely at our diversity problem and take action to correct it. Reshama was also instrumental in developing open source contributing sprints as a partnership between scikit-learn and Women in Machine Learning and Data Science, in an effort to get more women involved in the machine learning community.
